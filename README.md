## Project Description
Application that allows the user to search movies in various categories (based on the movie genre, director, actors, rating, release date, etc). Then the application will display a list of matching movies to the user, based on their input.

Why is it important or interesting?

Itâ€™s hard to search for the perfect movie. Therefore, we want to build a movie search engine that works for everyone - without tracking users and violating their privacy.

Languages/tools/technologies we plan to use:

Languages:
C++


Tools:
Google Test

[JsonCpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp), from `libjsoncpp-dev`

[libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/), from `libcurl4-openssl-dev`

[The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

Input/output of project:

Input: User specifies how the movies are sorted (trending, upcoming, or top_rated), how many movies to display, and a search query.

Output: A list of movies that matches the user's search query.

The design patterns we will be using:


Design Pattern 1: Composite Design Pattern

We have chosen the composite design pattern because it will allow us to create different objects that extends from a common base class. Each movie will have its own sub categories (Ex movie genre, director, actors, rating, release date). The pattern will allow us to include the various categories for each movie and allow the user to select multiple criteria for recommendation (e.g. this actor AND this genre). The client, user, will manipulate the objects through interactions with the menu interface. The chosen design pattern will be sufficient for the project because it will allow the database to have a complex category and search system. The composite design pattern will allow tree like structures where the composite class and the leaves are treated the same. They will us to use the same base class, the component class. For example, a movie genre can be described as a tree when compared to its subgenres.


Design Pattern 2: Strategy Design Pattern

We picked the Strategy design pattern because its features fit our project, our program will have different search queries based on the user input. We will implement different strategies with the design pattern, such as: Select_Contains, Select_And, Select_Not, etc. The user search query will be parsed by a factory method, where it updates the Select method(the pointer) to match the criteria. By using the Strategy design pattern, we can create new separate classes for each strategy method and implement all strategy-specific behaviors into them. This will allow the user to search for both specific movies or a broad-range of movies.


Design Pattern 3: Factory Design Pattern

We have added the factory design pattern because it will allow us to make the creation of the Selection object abstract. We are going to use the factory pattern to parse a user search query(string). This method will return or update root node(pointer) containing a tree of Select classes. In other words, the factory method will be creating a product of Select object.

Movies: This is the context class, it holds a Select pointer, movie data, among others. The search function is intended to be a factory method (which we might extract to its own class). This class is what the end user will mostly be interacting with.

Select: Interface, abstract class. 

Select_Contains: A concrete strategy. The select function returns true if the row(the movie) should be printed.

Select_Not: A concrete strategy that takes another Select pointer as input and performs the NOT logic operation. The method determines if some movie should be printed (if calling select from the input returns false).

Select_And: A concrete strategy that takes other Select pointers as input and performs the AND logic operation. The method determines if some movie should be printed (if calling select for both inputs returns true).

Select_Or: A concrete strategy that takes two Select pointers as input and performs the OR logic operation. The method determines if some movie should be displayed (if calling select for either one of the inputs returns true).




 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA during lab time. The TA will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members.
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Kanban board.
